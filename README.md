Developed a Blood Bank Management System, Streamlining blood donation processes with features such as donor registration, inventory tracking, and donor requests.
The Blood Bank Management Website is a dynamic and user-friendly web platform designed to optimize the critical operations involved in blood donation and inventory management. Developed using MySQL for database management and SQL for efficient data handling, with PhP HTML and CSS for the front-end interface, this open-source project is a comprehensive solution tailored for blood banks, hospitals, and organizations involved in blood donation and distribution.

Donor Requests: Hospitals and medical facilities can submit specific blood type and quantity requests through the website. The system efficiently manages these requests, sending notifications to potential donors for swift responses.

Appointment Scheduling: Donors can conveniently schedule blood donation appointments, reducing wait times and ensuring a consistent blood supply.

Admin Dashboard: Administrators benefit from a powerful dashboard that enables the management of donor records, inventory status monitoring, and donor request oversight. Real-time insights support informed decision-making.

Search and Reporting: The website offers robust search and reporting functionalities, allowing users to search for particular donors, generate reports, and analyze blood donation and usage trends.

User Authentication: To safeguard sensitive donor and patient data, the system includes user authentication mechanisms that ensure secure access and data protection.

Responsive Design: The website is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring accessibility and usability on a variety of devices and screen sizes.
